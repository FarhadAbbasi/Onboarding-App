# Flow Editor Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the onboarding flow creation system with state-of-the-art drag-and-drop editing capabilities and customizable UI elements.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. AI Content Generation Enhancement
- **Updated OpenAI prompts** in `src/lib/openai.ts` to use predefined customizable UI elements
- **Structured HTML output** with `data-element` attributes for proper parsing
- **Instructed AI** to use only allowed elements: headline, subheadline, cta, feature, testimonial, paragraph, alert, link, footer

### 2. HTML Parser Improvements
- **Enhanced AI HTML Parser** in `src/components/flow/editor/AIHtmlParser.tsx`
- **Added support** for `data-element` attributes (our new standard)
- **Backward compatibility** with existing `data-type` attributes
- **Better content extraction** for different element types

### 3. Fixed Linter Issues
- **Resolved BlockEditor.tsx** linter error by removing undefined `blockTree` reference
- **Fixed type imports** to use type-only imports where required

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Editor Integration
- **Created SimpleFlowEditor** component integrated into FlowEditor
- **Added component library** with customizable UI elements
- **Integrated with existing flow** in FlowManager → FlowEditor → block editor mode

## Component Library
The drag-and-drop editor includes these customizable components:
- **Headline** - Dynamic headlines with color schemes and sizing
- **Subheadline** - Supporting text with customization options  
- **CTA Button** - Call-to-action buttons with variants and colors
- **Feature Card** - Feature highlights with icons and descriptions
- **Testimonial** - Customer testimonials with avatars and roles
- **Alert Message** - Important notices with different variants
- **Text Block** - General purpose text content

## How It Works

### 1. Flow Planning
- User provides app details and features
- AI generates structured onboarding flow plan
- Plan includes page purposes and content block types

### 2. Content Generation
- AI generates HTML content using predefined UI elements
- HTML is parsed into blocks (content) and theme (layout/styling)
- Blocks are saved to Supabase with proper structure

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Editing
- Users can drag components from sidebar to canvas
- Components are fully customizable with color schemes, sizes, variants
- Real-time editing with save functionality
- Mobile and desktop preview modes

### 4. Supabase Integration
- **onboarding_pages** table stores theme and HTML content
- **content_blocks** table stores individual customizable blocks
- **Separation of concerns** between presentation and content

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/openai.ts` - Enhanced AI prompts for customizable elements
- `src/components/flow/editor/AIHtmlParser.tsx` - Better HTML parsing
- `src/components/flow/FlowEditor.tsx` - Integrated drag-and-drop editor
- `src/components/editor/BlockEditor.tsx` - Fixed linter errors
- `src/components/flow/editor/EnhancedFlowEditor.tsx` - Comprehensive editor (has type issues)

## Next Steps
1. **Resolve TypeScript issues** in EnhancedFlowEditor.tsx
2. **Add more customization options** (fonts, spacing, animations)
3. **Integrate theme customization** panel
4. **Add component variants** and advanced styling options
5. **Improve mobile responsiveness** of the editor interface

## Usage
1. Create a new project in FlowManager
2. Generate flow plan with AI
3. AI creates content using customizable elements
4. Edit pages using drag-and-drop interface
5. Customize elements with color schemes, sizes, and variants
6. Save and publish the final onboarding flow

The system now provides a seamless workflow from AI-generated content to fully customizable drag-and-drop editing, making it easy for users to create professional onboarding experiences.
